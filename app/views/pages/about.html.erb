                <hr>
                I studied initially  Administration in Colombia at the Corporacion Unificada Nacional CUN, however,
                when I was in my final semesters I realized my career was related with creation; After wanderig
                around I found coding to be challenging and excitig a the same time so I decided to 
                give it a try. I not only got to like it but felt in love with it. 
                For me software engineering is not only about writing code, it is about, having the opportunity 
                to  bring ideas into life, to create things for the well being of humanity and to contribute
                as a family of the world by leaving a finger print and by contibuting and helping each other.And like Tonny Robbins says, life 
                is about giving by becoming more.<hr> <q>Life is a gift, and it offers us the privilege, opportunity, and responsibility to give something back by becoming more. Tony Robbins</q>
